My time at Venture was productive, and I was excited to be leading the new Data Lakehouse design and building Azure/Databricks data pipelines for their IT modernization. However, a few months into the role, I was unexpectedly diagnosed with a serious heart valve issue.
This required me to undergo immediate, planned surgery and a recovery period that required an extended leave of absence. Out of respect for the team—as we were entering a critical period with a major SAP HANA migration and the new data lakehouse design—I made the difficult decision to resign in June to allow them to quickly backfill the critical role and focus entirely on my health and recovery.
I'm happy to report the surgery was a success, and I have completed my recovery and rehabilitation program. I am now fully recovered, have full medical clearance, and am highly motivated to jump back into a challenging, full-time role like this one, bringing my expertise in AI, Industrial 4.0, and data engineering from both Venture and my 8 years at Micron.
