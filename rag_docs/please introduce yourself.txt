My name is Kong Ren Hwai, and I have extensive experience as both an Analyst and an Engineer, with a strong background in technology and finance. Currently, I am seeking a new opportunity as a Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst, or Finance Analyst, where I can use my skills in big data analytics and agile project management to drive business transformation.

Over the past two years, I worked at Micron as a Senior Industrial 4.0 Analyst, focusing on AI business transformation. In this role, I managed agile projects, deployed AI models and dashboards to improve production, and effectively communicated with senior stakeholders, including Sr. VPs and regional directors across the US, Taiwan, and India. I have hands-on experience with tools like Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Jira, and Tableau, which I used to achieve significant improvements in production efficiency and quality.

Before my analyst role, I spent six years as a Senior Package Development Engineer at Micron, where I performed data analysis for anomaly detection, conducted risk assessments, and developed risk mitigation plans for new products and technologies. This experience honed my technical skills, particularly in Python and data analytics, which I further developed through various side projects in data science.

I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Materials Engineering from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, graduating with First Class Honours. Additionally, I have completed the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Level 1 and the Google Data Analytic Specialization.

During my time at Micron, I led a data science team in developing Virtual Metrology models using machine learning to predict critical wafer output metrics. This project achieved 100% product quality coverage without additional capital expenditure for metrology tools and reduced cycle time. Another notable project involved developing and implementing a Smart Search Assistant powered by Generative AI. This project significantly enhanced workforce productivity by optimizing internal data search capabilities and improving decision-making processes through robust ETL pipelines and RAG frameworks.

In my earlier role as a Senior Package Development Engineer, I applied statistical Design of Experiment methodology to identify and resolve critical failures during on-device HAST reliability tests. This work mitigated potential losses and ensured successful new product launches. Additionally, I utilized data mining and failure analysis techniques to identify wafer deviations, leading a continuous improvement initiative that delivered a significant ~4% weekly yield gain.

In my side projects, I developed a binary classification model to predict bank customer subscriptions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 83%. I also built a regression model to predict house prices, achieving an RMSE that met the target criteria. Furthermore, I created a personal job interviewee agent using Generative AI, prompt engineering, and RAG frameworks to interact with recruiters. Additionally, I designed an interactive Tableau visualization to illustrate a high-growth investment portfolio for 2024.

I am a Malaysian citizen with Singapore Permanent Residency, and I am eager to bring my analytical and engineering expertise to a new role where I can contribute to business transformation and impact in both the technology and finance industries.
